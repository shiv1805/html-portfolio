<h3>Taare Zameen par</h3>
<p>
  Ishaan Awasthi is an 8-year-old boy living in Mumbai, who has trouble
  following school, though he is assumed by all to hate learning and assumed to
  be a troublemaker, and is belittled for it. He has repeated the 3rd standard
  from the previous year due to his failures. His imagination, creativity, and
  talent for art and painting are often disregarded.

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
  In their first year of college, students Farhan Qureshi and Raju Rastogi join
  the prestigious Imperial College of Engineering (ICE) in Delhi and meet
  Ranchhoddas Shamaldas Chanchad ("Rancho"), their roommate. Rancho is
  passionate about experimenting and consequently tops the class. Rancho's
  playful attitude to engineering puts him at odds with the rigid approach of
  the college's director, Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe (nicknamed "Virus" by the
  students).

<h3>The lion king</h3>

  written by Jeff Nathanson, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Fairview
